        <p>My names are Jahzerah Josiah Mwalukasa. I'm a IT Solution Engineer Trainee at Midata-Tech Ltd.
            I would like to reach higher steps in joining this IT Course because I do love dealing with 
            computers since my childhood mostly inspired by My Dad Chief Technical Officer Josiah Absalom 
            and with that being so I do want to unleash major positions in the Tech World Community
            travelling the world and reaching out to oustide countries to learn and explore more on the built 
            New World Wide Technologies each day.
